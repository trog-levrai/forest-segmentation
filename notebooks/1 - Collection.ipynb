    "\n",
    "## Sentinel 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentinel2 data is available [here](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/). This program provides free multi spectral satellite imagery of the whole planet with a refresh rate of 3 to 5 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution depends on the band you are interested in, the highest being 10m and lowets being 60m.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the [`sentinelsat`](https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to select and download our data. You will need a free [account](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/userguide/SelfRegistration) for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CORINE\n",
    "\n",
    "The CORINE program is also a European program is a manual classification of the land cover in Europe. We will be using here the 2018 update as it is the latest and as we have sentinel data for this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used is available [here](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc2018) by going to the download tab and selecting the geoTiff. (You'll need a free account for that).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification contains 44 classes that you can find [here](https://land.copernicus.eu/eagle/files/eagle-related-projects/pt_clc-conversion-to-fao-lccs3_dec2010). Classes are grouped into 5 main categories:\n",
    "* Artificial surfaces\n",
    "* Agriculture area\n",
    "* Forest and semi natural area\n",
    "* Wetlands\n",
    "* Water bodies\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebooks, we will be interested in all kinds of forests, classes `311`, `312` ad `313`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we assume the data is stored in the `data/` folder. We also need to have a geometry available. If you do not like the default one, you can create one on [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/). This geometry will be used to search for tiles to download.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use here an approximate version of Normandy's Geometry as I like this region 😛\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to have a super accurate geometry at this step as this geometry is only used to query input data from the sentinel satellites."
